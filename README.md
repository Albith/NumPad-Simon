# NumPad-Simon
A simple game made in Unity in 2013. 

You will need a keyboard with a number pad to play this game.

Play a game of Simon, using the number pad.

Both Mac and web builds are available.  However, since the game is older, the web version doesn't run on WebGL and will not run on Chrome (tested on Safari 5.16.2017)
